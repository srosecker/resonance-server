"""
Music library database schema + access layer.

Goals:
- Modern, minimal, and testable (no LMS complexity).
- SQLite + aiosqlite, async/await friendly.
- Keep schema small, but leave room to evolve (via user_version migrations).

This module is intentionally independent of the web layer.

Note:
- Models/DTOs and normalization helpers live in `resonance.core.db.models`
- Schema/migrations live in `resonance.core.db.schema`
- Query functions live in `resonance.core.db.queries_*` modules
- `LibraryDb` remains the public facade used by the rest of the codebase
