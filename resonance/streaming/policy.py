"""
Shared streaming policy for Resonance.

This module is the single source of truth for decisions that must be consistent
across:
- HTTP streaming route behavior (direct vs. transcoded streaming)
- Slimproto `strm` format signaling (what the player is told to expect)

Why this exists:
- Previously, the list of "always transcode" formats was duplicated in multiple
  modules. That creates drift and subtle playback bugs (player expects AAC while
  server actually streams FLAC, etc.).

Design goals:
- Keep policy decisions small, explicit, and easy to reason about.
- Prefer "safety first" behavior for unknown formats/devices.
- Avoid importing heavy modules at import time (FastAPI, etc.).

    - `ALWAYS_TRANSCODE_FORMATS` are formats we transcode regardless of device tier,

    - `NATIVE_STREAM_FORMATS` are formats that generally stream reliably over HTTP.
    - `TRANSCODE_TARGET_FORMAT` is what the server will output when transcoding.
